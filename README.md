# Personal Online Library Project

## General info
You can add your favourite books to the library. If you wish you can add an image of the book cover otherwise the mock cover will be added. There were a few challenges along the way â€“ one was defininetely building whole book card with javascript. I added a few new CSS feature for input to make the form look prettier. 
	
## Technologies
I used: 
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript &
- Figma

## Improvements
My project right now definitely has a simple, clean design and it is simple to use. I enjoyed the whole process of building it and i would like to add some additional features and improve my design. 

What i would like to add and improve: 
- store the books
- add an API to find books easier
- make the login option
- rating
- description
- genres of books
- sort books in the library
- additional info on how many books are stored
- improve the design
